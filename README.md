This is a two player, online pong game, designed to be played over the internet on a Unix server, using sockets. The server program first waits for both client programs to start, then begins playing the game. The server program runs the game on a real-time interrupt using the SIGALRM signal, while waiting for calls from the clients in the main function. The client programs call the server to ask for the gamestate, and generate the graphics on their end accordingly. The client programs also respond to user input for moving the paddle, and call the server to update the game accordingly when it happens.
